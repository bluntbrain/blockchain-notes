A coin is the default cryptocurrency of a blockchain. For instance, Ether (ETH) is the default currency on the Ethereum blockchain. When a cryptocurrency uses or “borrows” another blockchain's network, then it is considered a token.

Bitcoin's Monetary Policy

1. The Halving
a Bitcoin halving is the process of halving the rewards of mining Bitcoin after each set of 210,000 blocks is mined. By reducing the rewards of mining Bitcoin as more blocks are mined, a Bitcoin halving limits the supply of new coins, so prices could rise if demand remains strong.
