My journey through solidity

Since there are millions of transactions, transactions get grouped together in blocks. Hence the name. These blocks are chained together in a cryptographically verifiable way so they are historically traceable. The current state of a network can be recalculated at any time by starting from the genesis block and transitioning the state according to each block's information up until now.

By storing data in a peer to peer network of nodes, the blockchain is a decentralized network.

What is web3?
Web3, the future internet we’re moving towards, is a decentralized internet. Under Web3, the internet is shared online and governed by the collective “we,” rather than owned by centralized entities. 

```shell
Web1: Read
Web2: Read-Write
Web3: Read-Write-Own
```

What is Ethereum?
It maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Work (PoW). In the near future Ethereum will be moving to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism.

ERC20 Tokens
In addition to Ether, people can create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit a specific standard. 

ERC721 and ERC1155 Tokens
These are what are also called NFTs. These two standards, similar to ERC20, provide a base line for what requirements should be met when creating NFTs. They provide similar benefits as well, allowing wallets and NFT marketplaces to instantly be compatible with all NFT collections as they all follow one of these two standards.
