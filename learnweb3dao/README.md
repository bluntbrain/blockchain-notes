The use of a blockchain confirms that each unit of value was transfered only once, and the ingenious mechanisms put forth by Satoshi Nakamoto solved the long-standing decentralized double-spending problem. </br>

Ethereum </br>
It maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Stake (PoS). The Serenity Patch, introduced in September of 2022, made the switch for Ethereum going from Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake mechanism.</br>

ERC20 Tokens</br>

In addition to Ether, people can create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit a specific standard. Developers can extend beyond the standard, but should meet the minimum requirements when making their own token. The standardization allows for digital wallets to easily support all types of tokens, without needing specialized code for each token created.</br></br>

ERC721 and ERC1155 Tokens</br>

These are what are also called NFTs. These two standards, similar to ERC20, provide a base line for what requirements should be met when creating NFTs. They provide similar benefits as well, allowing wallets and NFT marketplaces to instantly be compatible with all NFT collections as they all follow one of these two standards.</br></br>

There are 3 types of variables in Solidity

    Local
        Declared inside a function and are not stored on blockchain
    State
        Declared outside a function to maintain the state of the smart contract
        Stored on the blockchain
    Global
        Provide information about the blockchain. They are injected by the Ethereum Virtual Machine during runtime.
        Includes things like transaction sender, block timestamp, block hash, etc.
